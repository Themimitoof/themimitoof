Hey! I'm Michael aka _Themimitoof_, software engineer based in _Paris, France_ (and sometimes in _Braga, Portugal_).

I'm mainly a Pythonista at work and I play with Go on my free time. For my love of infrastructures and with my infinite
curiosity, I also wear the hat of a system and network administrator.
